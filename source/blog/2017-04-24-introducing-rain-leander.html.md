Dear RDO Enthusiast,

We have some important news this week about what’s shifting in the RDO
community.

As you may know, Rich Bowen has been serving in the role of Community
Liaison for the last 4 years. In that capacity, he’s done a variety of
things for the community, including event coordination, social media,
podcasts and videos, managing the website, and so on.

Starting next week, this role is going to include Rain Leander as
TripleO Community Liaison. Rain has been working with the RDO community,
and, more generally, with Red Hat’s upstream OpenStack development
efforts, for the past 18 months. She’s helped out at a number of events,
including two OpenStack Summits, numerous OpenStack Days and Meetups.
And she’s been a passionate advocate of TripleO in the community at large.

You may have seen her at some of these events and you’ve probably seen
her on IRC as leanderthal. Please give her all the support that you’ve
given Rich as she moves into this role.

If you have any questions about how this is going to work, what Rain’s
priorities will be in the coming months, or concerns about getting stuff
done in the next few months, please don’t hesitate to contact either one
of us via email (rain@redhat.com and rbowen@redhat.com), on IRC
(leanderthal and rbowen) or via Twitter (@rainleander and @rbowen).


Thanks,

Rich Bowen and Rain Leander
