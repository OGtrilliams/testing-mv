This week, RDO will have a presence at the [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) conference, in Brussels, Belgium.

First, on Friday, there will be a number of RDO-related presentations at the [CentOS Dojo](https://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2017) which will be held at the Marriott Grand Place. [Registration is free](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/centos-dojo-brussels-belgium-3rd-feb-2017-tickets-29571906368) but there are a very limited number of spaces available, so register soon to secure your spot.

On Saturday and Sunday, RDO will be sharing space with CentOS in the [stands area](https://fosdem.org/2017/stands/), along with dozens of other Free/Open Source organizations, projects, and foundations. We'll also be helping to staff the OpenStack stand.
