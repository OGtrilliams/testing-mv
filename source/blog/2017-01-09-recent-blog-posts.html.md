I've been out for a few weeks, but the blog posts from the community kept coming.

**Containers on the CERN cloud** by Tim Bell

> We have recently made the Container-Engine-as-a-Service (Magnum) available in production at CERN as part of the CERN IT department services for the LHC experiments and other CERN communities. This gives the OpenStack cloud users Kubernetes, Mesos and Docker Swarm on demand within the accounting, quota and project permissions structures already implemented for virtual machines.We shared the latest news on the service with the CERN technical staff (link). This is the follow up on the tests presented at the OpenStack Barcelona (link) and covered in the blog from IBM.

**ANNOUNCE: New libvirt project Go XML parser model** by Daniel Berrange

**Comparing OpenStack Neutron ML2+OVS and OVN – Control Plane** by russellbryant

> We have done a lot of performance testing of OVN over time, but one major thing missing has been an apples-to-apples comparison with the current OVS-based OpenStack Neutron backend (ML2+OVS).  I’ve been working with a group of people to compare the two OpenStack Neutron backends.  This is the first piece of those results: the control plane.  Later posts will discuss data plane performance.
