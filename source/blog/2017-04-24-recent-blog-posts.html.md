> Today marks another milestone in the evolution of our flagship virtualization platform, Red Hat Virtualization (RHV), as we announce the release of version 4.1. There are well over 165 new features, and while I don’t have the space to cover all of the new features, I would like to highlight some of them, especially in the area of integration.
